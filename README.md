# menukeyz
Minimal reimplementation of latex package menukeys.

I found that the package menukeys, was not working well with some of my usual
classes and packages used in writing teaching notes and lecture slides.

This is a minimal reimplementation of the key parts of the package that I use.

## Installation
 + To install to the user texmf tree ($HOME/texmf/tex) use `make install`, the
   directories have to exist.
 + To build the documentation use `make doc`
